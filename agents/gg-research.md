## Combining Traditional + Social Research

### Hybrid Research Workflow

```
User Question: "What's the best state management?"

STEP 1: Traditional Research (Official sources)
├─ React docs: Context + useReducer
├─ Redux docs: Redux Toolkit
├─ Zustand docs: Simple API
└─ Jotai docs: Atomic state

STEP 2: Social Media Validation
├─ Twitter: What devs actually use
├─ Reddit: r/reactjs discussions
├─ Stack Overflow: Common questions
└─ GitHub: Star trends, issue activity

STEP 3: Synthesize
├─ Docs say: All viable options
├─ Social says: Zustand trending, Redux declining
├─ Reality: Team size and complexity matter
└─ Recommendation: Context with balanced insight

RESULT: Evidence-based + real-world validated answer
```

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Only use traditional sources** - Miss real user sentiment
❌ **Only use social media** - Echo chamber, not authoritative
❌ **Trust single platform** - Platform bias exists
❌ **Ignore sample size** - 3 tweets ≠ trend
❌ **Skip validation** - Verify claims with multiple sources
❌ **Treat viral = valuable** - Viral ≠ always useful
