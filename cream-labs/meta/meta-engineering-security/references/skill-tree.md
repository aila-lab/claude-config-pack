# Security Engineering Skill Tree

## Contract security skills

- `/Users/ege/.codex/skills/secure-workflow-guide/SKILL.md` - 5-step ToB secure workflow
- `/Users/ege/.codex/skills/audit-prep-assistant/SKILL.md` - audit preparation checklist
- `/Users/ege/.codex/skills/guidelines-advisor/SKILL.md` - architecture and implementation review
- `/Users/ege/.codex/skills/code-maturity-assessor/SKILL.md` - 9-category maturity scoring

## App and process security skills (local)

- `.claude/skills/security-compliance/SKILL.md` - security architecture and risk controls
- `.claude/skills/requesting-code-review/SKILL.md` - mandatory review gate
- `.claude/skills/webapp-testing/SKILL.md` - runtime and browser-level behavior checks

## Project security references

- `docs/SKILLS.md` sections:
  - `Web3 Testing Skill`
  - `Solidity Security Skill`
  - `Trail of Bits: Building Secure Contracts`
  - `Trail of Bits: Testing Handbook`
  - `Supabase Security (Next.js)`
  - `Verification Before Completion`
  - `Security & Compliance Skill`

## Usage pattern

1. Start with static tooling.
2. Run contract and app adversarial tests.
3. Review findings and log accepted risks.
4. Export shareable path lists for team handoff.
